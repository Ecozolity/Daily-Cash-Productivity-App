# Daily-Cash-Productivity-App
Measuring Enough Cash Liquidity 
but not being scared 
to take risk a portion 
of it;

just in time when,
where, and what specific
activity or cycle 
to confidently
put it in with the
purpose of successfully
creating an
income-producing 
source, so you are not
so stressed out, and
have a consistent time
to have fun, while
your cash keeps coming in while
having fun, and not being
punished for having some fun.
